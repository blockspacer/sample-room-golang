# This is the startup script for the golang GameOn! room.
#
# The following environment variables are required:
#   CONTAINER_IP  - The public IP address to which your container is bound.
#                   (This is needed for the websocket callback.)
#   GAMEON_ID     - The ID given in Game On!
#   GAMEON_SECRET - The shared secret given in Game On!
#   ROOM_NAME     - Your name for the room.
#
# The following environment variables are optional:
#   GAMEON_ADDR   - The game server address, defaults to gameontext.org.
#   GAMEON_PORT   - Our external port, defaults to 3000.
#                   (This is needed for the websocket callback.)
#   GAMEON_DEBUG  - Any non-empty value turns on debug output
#   GAMEON_TIMESHIFT - Use this to adjust our timestamps to match the
#                      GameOn! server in cases where the time is skewed
#                      relative to our room and the server. This is
#                      expressed in milliseconds. The default is 0.
#
#   The following two variables allow for a delay in network connectivity.
#
#   GAMEON_REG_RETRIES - Number of initial registration attempts.
#                        Defaults to 5
#   GAMEON_REG_SECONDS_BETWEEN - Number of seconds between registration
#                                attempts. Defaults to 30
